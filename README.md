# NBIS repository for the Local EGA project

The [code](./src) is written in Python (3.6+).

You can provision and deploy, locally, the different components
using [docker-compose](./docker).

We plan on having a provisioning script for OpenStack, along with a
deployment script using Ansible. Stay tuned.
